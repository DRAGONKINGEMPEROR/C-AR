# C-AR
Project a car in real world with custom experience with AI

C-AR is an application that demonstrates the use of Augmented Reality. Using this application the user can augment a projection of a car in the real world and it is visible through the mobile device. User would be able to experience the presence of a virtual model as a real car. The user would be abe to see it from any angles, any position aor from any aspects. With enhanced features like use of a custom AI bot for listening and acting on your voice commands, would give a mesmerising experience.


## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whose elements are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment) and is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one’s ongoing perception of a real world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.

###### Vuforia

Vuforia is an Augmented Reality Software Development Kit (SDK) for mobile devices that enables the creation of Augmented Reality applications. It uses Computer Vision technology to recognize and track planar images (Image Targets) and simple 3D objects, such as boxes, in real-time. This image registration capability enables developers to position and orient virtual objects, such as 3D models and other media, in relation to real world images when these are viewed through the camera of a mobile device. The virtual object then tracks the position and orientation of the image in real-time so that the viewer’s perspective on the object corresponds with their perspective on the Image Target, so that it appears that the virtual object is a part of the real world scene.
The Vuforia SDK supports a variety of 2D and 3D target types including ‘markerless’ Image Targets, 3D Multi-Target configurations, and a form of addressable Fiducial Marker known as a VuMark. Additional features of the SDK include localized Occlusion Detection using ‘Virtual Buttons’, runtime image target selection, and the ability to create and reconfigure target sets programmatically at runtime.
Vuforia provides Application Programming Interfaces (API) in C++, Java, Objective-C++ (a language utilizing a combination of C++ and Objective-C syntax), and the .NET languages through an extension to the Unity game engine. In this way, the SDK supports both native development for iOS and Android while also enabling the development of AR applications in Unity that are easily portable to both platforms. AR applications developed using Vuforia are therefore compatible with a broad range of mobile devices including the iPhone, iPad, and Android phones and tablets running Android OS version 2.2 or greater and an ARMv6 or 7 processor with FPU (Floating Point Unit) processing capabilities.
